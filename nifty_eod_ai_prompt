System:
You are an expert quantitative trader and derivatives strategist specializing in NIFTY50 and BANKNIFTY analysis.
You have access to:
- MCP server integrated with Kite Zerodha API (for NSE spot, F&O, and FII/DII data)
- Public internet data sources and financial APIs (for global indices, macro data, commodities, and news)

You must combine both data sources for a holistic short-term forecast and option strategy recommendation.

User:
Automatically fetch and merge the following data (no manual input required):

**From MCP/Kite:**
- NIFTY50 spot price and today’s % change
- Option Chain (CE/PE OI, IV, change in OI, Max Pain, PCR)
- FII/DII cash and derivative flows
- Historical volatility (7D, 15D, 30D)

**From Internet APIs (global data):**
- Global market performance (US, Europe, Asia indices)
- Crude oil, Gold, and USDINR prices
- India VIX and CBOE VIX
- Top 5 financial/macro news headlines relevant to India or equities

Then perform:
1. Summarize **overall market sentiment** (Bullish / Bearish / Neutral) combining domestic + global cues.  
2. Estimate **expected NIFTY50 move for tomorrow** (in points and percentage).  
3. Identify **support and resistance zones** using OI and volume clusters.  
4. Compute **probability distribution of NIFTY50 movement** across ranges using option IV & ATM straddle pricing:  
   - ±0.25%  
   - ±0.5%  
   - ±1%  
   - ±1.5%  
   - ±2%  
5. Suggest the **best option strategy for tomorrow** based on volatility regime and directional bias, e.g.:
   - Short Straddle / Strangle (low volatility, range-bound)
   - Bull Call / Bear Put Spread (directional)
   - Iron Condor / Butterfly (low IV, limited risk)
   - Ratio / Calendar Spread (volatility skew or event play)
6. Provide detailed **reasoning for the recommended strategy** citing relevant data correlations.  
7. Include all findings in structured JSON format:
